Hi! I am Collene De Silva, a soon-to-be Full Stack Developer on the path of JavaScript with the help of The Odin Project and its community! This is where I will keep my notes to secure it and prevent the loss of data when my resources will crash. *hope not*

You are free to include your notes, comments, or additional info for me that may help me through my journey! I will really appreciate it. Thank you in advance!
