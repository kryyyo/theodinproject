File Structure Tips
    1. all lowercase and no spaces
        - if spaces needed, use "-"
    2. make names short for faster loading time 
    3. always start with "index.html" since it will always be the homepage
    4. do not use spaces 

    Main folder
    -index.html         -always outside 
    -otherpages.html
    -folder for css
    -folder for js
    -folder for img
    and so on....
