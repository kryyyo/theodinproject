Additional notes: 
    styling an input's placeholder: 

        ::placeholder 

    order is important in pseudoclasses because their specificity are all the same ! 
        eg. 
            input:invalid { color: red }
            input:enabled { color: black }

    secret selector to detect when the user has already an input: 

        :placeholder-shown
            -if user has no input yet

    you can also use not() 

        not(:placeholder-shown) 
            -if user has an input already
