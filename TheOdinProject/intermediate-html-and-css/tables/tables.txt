Table (MDN)
    - structured set of data made up of rows and columns 
    - tabular data
    - quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data

    Do not use for layouting web pages! 
        1. Reduce accessibility for visually impared users
        2. Produces tag soup 
            harder to write, maintain and debug
        3. not automatically responsive 

    Why are headers useful? 
        1. easier to find data
        2. added benefit along with the scope attribute

    Spanning 
        Attributes:
            colspan="no. of columns to be occupied"
            rowspan="no. of rows to be occupied"

    Styling without <col> 
        add class to each td/th 
        css select and style 

    Styling with <col>
        eg.
            <colgroup>
                <col>       // 1st column no style 
                <col style="background-color: yellow">      // 2nd column with style
            </colgroup>
            <table>
                // this is the table that is being targeted 
            </table>

HTML table advanced features and accessibility
    Adding a caption to your table with <caption>
        <table>
            <caption>
                // best place before all the data so user can have the overview
                // caption here
            </caption>
        </table>

        particularly for blind users
        overview of the table 

        summary Attribute 
            - can also be used but sighted users cannot see this attribute so caption is the best for both blinded and sighted

        
    Adding structure with <thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody>
        - do not make any more accessibility 
        - don't result in any visual enhancement on their own 
        - but useful for styling and for acting as hooks
