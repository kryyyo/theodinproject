2 Aspects of a functional HTML form: 
    frontend UI (form elements)
    backend server (form processing)

    The name attribute defines the name of this variable, and the value is whatever the user entered into the text field.

    Every radio button group you create should:
        Be wrapped in a <fieldset>, which is labeled with a <legend>.
        Associate a <label> element with each radio button.
        Use the same name attribute for each radio button in the group.
        Use different value attributes for each radio button

Generally speaking, there are two ways to process forms:

    1. Use the action attribute to send the form data to a backend URL, which then redirects to a success or error page. We got a little glimpse of this in the previous section, and it doesnâ€™t require any JavaScript.
    
    2. Use AJAX queries to submit the form without leaving the page. Success or error messages are displayed on the same page by manipulating the HTML with JavaScript.
