pwd
    -present working directory


ls
    -list files and directories

    listing a different directory: ls [full location here]
    listing all files: ls -a
    long form listing: ls -l

    human readable sizes (1B, 1kb): ls -lh

    sorting by size: ls -lhS
    sorting by last modified time: ls -lt

    reverse sort: ls -lr
    reverse sort with size - lSr

ln 
    -for linking between two files

    types: Hard and Symbolic
        Hard links - create an identical copy of the linked file on disk
                    - if source is changed, so is the linked file
                    -only works for same file system (same extension)

                Syntax: ln [name of source file with extension] [name of target file you want to create]
                    additional commands
                        forcing a link (if there is an exisiting target file already): ls -f

        Symbolic links - can link directories too
                        - can link different file system
                Syntax: ln -s [source file] [target file]
rm
    -deleting a file

cat 
    -to see contents of a file

cd
    -changing directories

    to a directory: cd [directory link]
    navigating up: cd ..
    to home: cd

mkdir
    -creating directories 

    normal: mkdir [folder name]
    with intermediate (nested) directories: mkdir -p [folder a]/[folder b]/[folder c]
    verbose output (print the made directory): mkdir -v [folder]

cp
    -copying files 

    single file: cp [source file] [target file] (mapupunta sa directory nung target file)
    multiple files: cp [source file1] [source file2]..... [directory]
    by extension: cp [*.ext] [directory]
 
    copying a directory: cp -R [source directory] [directory]

    repeating commands (for copying/linking/deleting) - add this to your command just right after the main command
        verbose output: -v
        forcing: -f
        confirm overwriting: -i
        for directories: -R

mv
    -moving files 
    -same as copying syntax (pero may added rm na)

    single file: mv [source file] [target file] (mapupunta sa directory nung target file)
    multiple files: mv [source file1] [source file2]..... [directory]
    by extension: mv [*.ext] [directory]
 
    copying a directory: mv -R [source directory] [directory]

    -can also be used to rename a directory


    mv [location of the first directory] [location with new name of directory]
        eg: mv /home/test /home/lol
        from test >>> lol 

input/output

    redirecting output
        -using pipe (|) operator
        -to input another command
        -parang steps in one line, execute step1 | step2 

        eg. ls -a ~ | grep _
            - command use to get display all file types but only with "_"

            ls -a ~ | grep _ | sed "s/_/-/g"
            - command use to get display all file types but only with "_" then replace it with "-"

    writing to a file
        -using (>) operator
        -ilalagay mo sa file yung kinuha mo sa step 1

        eg. ls -a ~ | grep _ > underscore.txt
            - find all files, only with underscore, put contents on underscore.txt
        
    reading from a file
        -using (<) operator
        -instead of writing, reading lang
