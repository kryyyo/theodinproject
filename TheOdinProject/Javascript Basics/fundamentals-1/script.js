// // Tasks (practices)

// //Working with Variables - same solution
// let name, admin

// name = 'John'
// admin = name

// alert(admin)

// //Giving the Right Name 

// const ourPlanet = 'Earth';          //let ourPlanetName = "Earth";
// let currentVisitor = 'John';        //let currentUserName = "John";

// //note: a name with 3 words is fine




//Assignment (try the following exercises)

// Add 2 numbers together! (just type console.log(23 + 97) into your html file)
    console.log(23+97)

// Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together.
    console.log(1+2+3+4+5+6)

// Print the solution to the following equation: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77
    let x = (4 + 6 + 9) / 77
    console.log(x.toFixed(5))
// Answer should be approximately 0.24675


// Let’s use variables!
// Type the following at the top of the script tag: let a = 10
// In the console console.log(a) should print 10
    let a = 10
    console.log(a)

// Try the following: 9 * a
    9 * a

// and this: let b = 7 * a (returns undefined *) and then console.log(b)
    let b = 7 * a
    console.log(b)

// You should be getting the hang of this by now… try this sequence:
// Declare a constant variable max with the value 57
    const max = 57;

// Set another variable actual to max - 13
    const actual = max - 13;

// Set another variable percentage to actual / max
    const percentage = actual / max

// If you type percentage in the console and press enter you should see a value like 0.7719
    console.log(percentage.toFixed(4))




// Take a few minutes to keep playing around with various things in your script tag. Eventually, we will learn how to actually make those numbers and things show up on the webpage, but all of this logic will remain the same, so make sure you’re comfortable with it before moving on.
