The Anatomy of an Error
    type of OBJECT
        consists of:    
            name/type
            message 

            message can contain
                at fileName:lineNumber:charNumber

    THROWING an error
        -generating an error

    stack trace
        when the error was thrown, and what function were called to led up to this 

        lets you trace the evolution of an error back to its origin

        eg. 
        Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined 
            at add (script.js:5)
            at print (script.js:9)
            at script.js:12

            1. c is not defined in scope of add(), which is declared on line 5
            2. add() was called by print(), which was declared on line 9
            3. print() itself was called on line 12.

Common Types of Errors 

    Syntax Error
        code not written correctly (grammatical rules of JS)

    Reference Error
        variable does not exist, variable undefined (within current scope)
        or variable spelt incorrectly

    Type Error
        thrown when:
            - operand/argument is not of the same type as expected by the operator/function 
            - modifying a value that CANNOT be changed (const)
            - attempting to use a value in an appropriate way

        note: always consider the data type!
