UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
    first step in solving a problem 

    write down, reword in plain English, draw diagram if it helps

PLAN
    questions you need to answer at this stage:

        1. Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.

        2. What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?

        3. What’s the desired output?

        4. Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
            -writing an algorithm (like a recipe)

PSEUDOCODE
    writing out the logic in natural language 

    eg. 

        When the user inputs a number
        Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
        While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
        Print the value of the counter variable

DIVIDE AND CONQUER
    picking smallest or simplest one and start there with coding

    decomposing problems into smaller and easier to solve subproblems is a much better approach 

SOLVING FIZZ BUZZ
    Understanding the problem
        write a program that will print the numbers from one to the number the user entered. multiples of 3 will be printed as 'Fizz', multiples of 5 will be printed as 'Buzz', and multiples of 3 and 5 will be printed as 'FizzBuzz'
    
    Plan 
        1. Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.

            -command-line only. no gui

        2. What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?

            -number where the fizzbuzz program will end. from the user (command line)

        3. What’s the desired output?
            
            -list numbers from 1 to the user entered. multiples of 3 will be fizz. multiples of 5 will be buzz. mulitples of 3 and 5 will be fizzbuzz

        4. Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
            -writing an algorithm (like a recipe)

        PSEUDOCODE
            1. prompt the user for an ending number 
            2. loop from 1 to the entered number (or increment)
            3. if current number is divisible by 3, replace current number with 'fizz'
            4. if current number is divisible by 5, replace current number with 'buzz'
            5. if current number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace current number with 'fizzbuzz'
            6. if not in the given conditions, print the number

    Divide and Conquer 
        let endingNumber = parseInt(prompt('Please enter your number'));

        for (let i = 1; i <= endingNumber; i++) {
            if (i % 3 === 0) {
                console.log('fizz')
            } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
                console.log('buzz')
            } else if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
                console.log('fizzbuzz')
            } else 
                console.log(i)
        }
