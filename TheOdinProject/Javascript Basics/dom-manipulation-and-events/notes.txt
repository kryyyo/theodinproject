                    div.display
                    .display
                    #container > .display
                    div#container > div.display

DOM Methods 
    use to manipulate our webpage with Javascript

    Query Selectors 
        -element.querySelector(selector) returns a reference to the first match of selector

        -element.querySelectorAll(selectors) returns a “nodelist” containing references to all of the matches of the selectors
            -return value of this is NOT AN ARRAY even though it may look like an array
            -return value is a 'nodelist'
            -big difference is array methods are not all available in a nodelist 
                -a solution for this is to convert the nodelist into an array

                    syntax:
                        Array.form()
