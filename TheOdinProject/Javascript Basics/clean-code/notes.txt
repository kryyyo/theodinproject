Rules of Thumb 
    1. Indentation  - u choose
    2. Semicolons - optional but get used to adding semi colons 
    3. Line Length - limit/break lines about 80 characters
                    - when breaking: indent 2 line levels in the second line
                    - break immediately after an operator or comma 
    4. Naming Things - descriptive
                    - camelCase
                    - variables prefix : noun / adjective
                    - functions prefix: verb
                    - use only single characters in the context of loop or callback function (eg. i) but not elsewhere 

10 Principles for Keeping Your Programming Code Clean (onextrapixel.com)

1. Revise Your Logic Before Coding
        -flow diagrams or written pseudo-code

2. Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page
        -main containers with a representative ID

3. Use the Correct Indentation

4. Write Explanatory Comments

5. Avoid Abusing Comments
        DO NOT: 
            -write explanatory notes to self
                eg. //will finish this later 

            -blame stuff on other people
                eg. //John coded this. Ask him

            -write vague statemets 
                eg. //this is another function

            -erasing chunks of code
                delete!
            
        Good Comments: 
            -Authoring specifications
                eg. //Coded by John, Nov 13, 2020
            -Detailed statemets on the functionality or procedure
                eg. //This function validates the login form with the aid of the e-mail check function 
            -Quick notifications or labels that state where a recent change was made 
                eg. //Added e-mail validation procedure

6. Avoid Extremely Large Functions
        -break up large functions (repetitive language)

7. Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables
        - depends on your team what naming standards are you going to use 

8. Treat Changes with Caution
        -keep the correct indentations 
        -commenting on the modification made
        -respecting standards 

9. Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages
        -better use external sources

10. Summarize your imports 
        -lesser external sources the better 
    

blog.codinghorror.com Additional Notes

we need comments to tells us WHY it works, NOT HOW because we already have the code to tell us that
        -concentrate on explaining to a human what we want a computer to do

You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist. 

Rely on CODE to tell the story, not on COMMENTS

if your feel your code is too complex to understand without comments, your code is probably just bad
