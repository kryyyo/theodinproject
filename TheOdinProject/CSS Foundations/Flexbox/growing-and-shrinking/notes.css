The flex shorthand
    flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis

    flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis];

    DEFAULT VALUE OF FLEX
    div {
        flex: 0 1 0%;
    }

    flex: 1;
    means: flex: 1 1 0%;

flex-grow
    -single number for its value
    -value is for 'growth factor'
    -flex: 1; - div will grow the same amount (x1)
    -flex: 2; - div will be 2x the size of others

flex-shrink
    -value is for 'shrink factor'
    -applied if and only if: size of all flex items is larger than their parent container

    same concept as flex-grow
    flex-shrink: 1; shrink evenly
    flex-shrink: 0; if you do not want the item to shrink

important implication:
    if you specify flex-grow and flex-shrink, your specified width may not be respected (items will grow to fill or shrink to fit)

flex-basis
    -sets the initial size of a flex item
    -growing and shrinking starts from that baseline

    flex-basis: 0; -items will ignore specified width and will shrink evenly 
    flex-basis: auto; -tells the item to check for width declaration

important note:
    default value for flex-basis is auto but
    @flex shorthand, flex: 1; will set flex-basis to 0

    if you want to make it auto, use full syntax:
    flex: 1 1 auto;
