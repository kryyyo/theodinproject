flexbox can work either HORIZONTALLY or VERTICALLY
    default: horizontal or ROW

    to change directions: 
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-direction: row;

Axes
    2 axes of flexbox:
        1. main axis
        2. cross axis 
    
        most cases: flex-direction: row; puts the main axis horizontal while flex-direction: column; puts the main axis vertical
    
again: flex-basis: 0; -will not consider your declared width (row) or declared height (column)

flex-direction: row; -block level elements default to full width of PARENT
flex-direction: column; -block level elements default to full height of CONTENT
