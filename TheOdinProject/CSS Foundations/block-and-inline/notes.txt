Block VS Inline
    block - see notes on the box model 
    inline - see notes on the box model

    note: do not put extra margin and padding in inline because it has little to no effect

Divs and Spans
    -generic containers

    Div
        -block-level
        -divide the page into different blocks
        -commonly use to group elements
    
    Span
        -inline-level
        -common to group text content

Normal Flow
    Block Flow Direction
        -top to bottom flow 
        -this is the normal flow for block elements
    
    Inline elements
        -no new line, no overflowing content will move down to a new line

CSS Layout Tutorial notes 
    responsive width (without horizontal scrolling)
        #main {
            max-width: 600px;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }

        by setting max-width, it prevents horizontal scrolling

Position Property
    position: value;

    static
        -default
        -not positioned in any special way 
    relative 
        -added properties can trigger to be different from static
        -can overlap
    fixed 
        -positioned relative to the viewport
        -stay on the same place even if the page is scrolled
        -do not leave gap in the page
    absolute
        -trickiest
        -behaves like fixed but relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport
        -if no ancestor, it uses the body

Float 
    -wrapping text around image 

    float: none|left|right|initial|inherit;

Clear
    -important for controlling the behavior of floats

    If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left.

    clear: none|left|right|both|inherit;

    clearfix hack: 

    .clearfix {
         overflow: auto;
    }

    .clearfix::after {
        content: "";
        clear: both;
        display: table;
    }

Percent Width Layout
    -we can use percentages for width so that it will be that percentage of its container in every viewport
