The Box Model  
    -concept: every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box 

    brief description:
        padding - distance between content inside and edge of the box 
        margin - increases space between the box and other boxes beside it
        border - adds space between the margin and the padding

    notes to consider:
        Margin Collapsing - margin between elements collapses with each other (not additive)
                - the higher margin between the two elements will prevail

                2 positives - higher number
                2 negative - higher absolute
                1 positive 1 negative - negative will be subtracted

        box-sizing: border-box;
            -padding and border is added to the overall height and width

The Box Model (MDN Web Docs)
    Block and inline boxes
        1. Outer display type of block
            -box will break into a new line
            -box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in the container. most cases, boxes are as wide as the container 
            -width and height are respected
            -padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
        
        2. Outer display type of inline 
            -box wil not break into new line
            -width and height will not apply 
            -vertical padding, margins and border will apply but will not cause other elements to be pushed away from the box (parang non-sense)
            -horizontal padding, margins, and border will apply and will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
    
    Aside: Inner and Outer display types
        outer - whether box is block or inline
        inner - how elements are laid out inside the box




    standard box model - height and width defines the CONTENT box only
                        - padding, margin and border is added to the total height and width
    alternative box model - box-sizing: border-box;
                        - height and width defines the total box (content + m + p + border)
