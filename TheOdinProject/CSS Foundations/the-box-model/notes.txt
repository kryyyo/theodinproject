The Box Model  
    -concept: every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box 

    brief description:
        padding - distance between content inside and edge of the box 
        margin - increases space between the box and other boxes beside it
        border - adds space between the margin and the padding

    notes to consider:
        Margin - margin between elements collapses with each other (not additive)
                - the higher margin between the two elements will prevail

        box-sizing: border-box;
            -padding and border is added to the overall height and width
